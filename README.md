# chapter-converter

Simple utility written in TypeScript to convert ChapterGrabber (v. 5.2) generated chapter files such as were obtained from the now defunct chapterdb.org to the Matroska chapter format such as used by MKVToolKit.
This is intended for personal archival non-commercial fair-use purposes only.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
node dist/src/index.js path-to-source-chapters.xml
```

The utility will write a new file ending in `-matroska.xml`, so be careful not to overwrite.

## Disclaimer

Piracy is theft. 
Please respect artists and content providers.
I use this to add chapters when remuxing or archiving my old VHS and DVR recordings for personal use only.  

Long live Plex.TV!
